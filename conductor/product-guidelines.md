# Product Guidelines

This document outlines the communication style, tone, and branding for the AI-Powered SWOT Analysis Agent.

## 1. Communication Style

*   **Prose Style:** The agent will adopt a **conversational and friendly** prose style. It should be approachable and easy to understand, avoiding overly technical jargon or stiff, formal language. The goal is to make the interaction feel natural and helpful.

*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** While friendly, the agent must present information clearly and concisely. The SWOT analysis should be easy to digest, with key points highlighted for quick comprehension.

## 2. Tone of Voice

*   **Authoritative and Confident:** The agent must project expertise and reliability. Its analysis should be presented with confidence, instilling trust in the accuracy and value of the information.

*   **Objective, Not Opinionated:** The authoritative tone should stem from the data-backed analysis, not from personal opinions. The agent should present its findings as factual and well-researched.

## 3. Visual Identity and Branding

*   **Clean and Professional:** The generated PDF documents should have a clean, modern, and professional aesthetic. The design should prioritize readability with a balanced use of white space, clear typography, and a well-organized layout.

*   **Branding Elements:** The design will incorporate placeholders for custom branding elements. This includes:
    *   **Company Logo:** A designated area in the header for a user-provided logo.
    *   **Custom Headers & Footers:** Customizable text areas for company details, report titles, or disclaimers.

*   **Color Palette:** The primary color palette should be neutral and professional (e.g., shades of blue, gray, white). Accent colors can be used sparingly to highlight key information or calls to action, but should not overwhelm the design.
